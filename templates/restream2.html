                            I discovered that there is an internal startup in the company related to video surveillance.
                            And since it involves video surveillance, there are IP cameras with Linux on board.
                            I gathered more information, met the team, and went through an internal interview.
                            After a while, I started handling system tasks with Linux: my goal was to create
                            a Linux firmware. It was the time of soldering irons and reverse engineering when
                            you needed to figure out how to launch the Linux kernel on new hardware. Mostly,
                            I worked with the Uboot bootloader source code, Linux kernel source code, and wrote
                            some system software in C responsible for device initialization.

                            - Started to work as Linux Firmware engineer for vanilla Linux + U-boot porting to IPC cameras<br>
                            - Learned how to use buildroot, yocto and other firmware building systems<br>
                            - Learned how to write simple kernel modules and edit existing<br>
                            - Learned how to reverse-engineered and reproduce firmware based on U-boot + Linux<br>                           
                            - Learned a lot new about Linux kernel internals
